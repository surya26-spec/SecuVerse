# SecuVerse (AI-IDS)

SecuVerse is an AI-Based Intrusion Detection System (AI-IDS) designed to
identify malicious and anomalous network behavior using intelligent
analysis rather than static rule-based firewalls.

## Features
- AI-driven intrusion detection
- Network traffic monitoring
- Attack and phishing simulation modules
- Dataset-driven ML training (NSL-KDD)
- Web dashboard for visualization

## Project Structure
- `app.py` – Main application
- `sniffer.py` – Network packet capture
- `model/` – Trained ML models and encoders
- `dataset/` – NSL-KDD training and test data
- `templates/` & `static/` – Web UI
- `Documentation_Site/` – Project documentation site

## Event
This project was developed and showcased at **HackXpo’26** under the name **SecuVerse**.
